# dMicEA
We have developed a user-friendly image analysis command that consists of known deep learning tools and image analysis tools.

To download the dMicEA folder from GitHub and set up the environment in Anaconda, perform the following steps:

In a terminal window, navigate to the location where you want to download the dMicEA folder.

Run the command: git clone https://github.com/hirohshi/dMicEA.git (replace [username] with the appropriate GitHub username).

Run the command: conda env create -n dMicEA_env -f dMicEA_env.yml

Run the command: conda activate dMicEA_env

Run the command: python setup.py develop

Once the environment is activated, you can use the dMicEA command in the terminal. 

To see a list of available options, run the command dMicEA --help. 

This will display all of the available commands for image analysis.
